JENKINS_HOME has a fairly obvious directory structure that looks like the following:

      JENKINS_HOME
       +- config.xml     (jenkins root configuration)
       +- *.xml          (other site-wide configuration files)
       +- userContent    (files in this directory will be served under your http://server/userContent/)
       +- fingerprints   (stores fingerprint records)
       +- plugins        (stores plugins)
       +- workspace (working directory for the version control system)
           +- [JOBNAME] (sub directory for each job)
       +- jobs
           +- [JOBNAME]      (sub directory for each job)
               +- config.xml     (job configuration file)
               +- latest         (symbolic link to the last successful build)
               +- builds
                   +- [BUILD_ID]     (for each build)
                       +- build.xml      (build result summary)
                       +- log            (log file)
                       +- changelog.xml  (change log)
