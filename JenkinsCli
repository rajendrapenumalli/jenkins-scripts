Usage: java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s URL] command [opts...] args...
Options:
-s URL       : the server URL (defaults to the JENKINS_URL env var)
-http        : use a plain CLI protocol over HTTP(S) (the default; mutually exclusive with -ssh and -remoting)
-ssh         : use SSH protocol (requires -user; SSH port must be open on server, and user must have registered a public key)
-remoting    : use deprecated Remoting channel protocol (if enabled on server; for compatibility with legacy commands or command modes only)
-i KEY       : SSH private key file used for authentication (for use with -ssh or -remoting)
-p HOST:PORT : HTTP proxy host and port for HTTPS proxy tunneling. See https://jenkins.io/redirect/cli-https-proxy-tunnel
-noCertificateCheck : bypass HTTPS certificate check entirely. Use with caution
-noKeyAuth   : dont try to load the SSH authentication private key. Conflicts with -i
-user        : specify user (for use with -ssh)
-strictHostKey : request strict host key checking (for use with -ssh)
-logger FINE : enable detailed logging from the client
-auth [ USER:SECRET | @FILE ] : specify username and either password or API token (or load from them both from a file);
for use with -http, or -remoting but only when the JNLP agent port is disabled
